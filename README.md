# Autocomplete-Engine

This Project is built from scratch. No APIs no Libraries.

This is a implementation of the autocomplete feature using Tries.
I've implemented a Dictionary which consists of 10,000 most frequent used english words.
I've also added the functionality to choose a file of your own.


To run this just download the jar file and choose the correct-word file.

file must be in txt format.


This could be extended by searching in DataBase.
